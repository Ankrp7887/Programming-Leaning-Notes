AWS Global infrastructure - 
    AWS Regions [ Asia Pacific(Mumbai) : ap-south-1, Asia Pacific(Sydney) : ap-southeast-2, US East(Ohio) : us-east-2 ]
        - clusters of data centers 
        - most AWS services are region scoped(service behaves as new if region is changed)
        For launching new application, how should you choose the region?
            - compliance : with gov and legal requirements
            - reduced latency : according to users' locations to give them min latency
            - service availability
            - pricing : vary from region to region

    AWS Availability zones [ ap-south-1 : ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b ap-south-1c ]
        - Each region has at least 3 isolated availability zones connected with high bandwidth ultra-low latency network
        - linked altogether forming a region

    AWS Data Centers
    AWS Edge Locations/ Points of Presence - Amazon has 400+ Points of presence



Ways to Access AWS
    1. AWS management Console (protected by password + MFA) - Web Interface
    2. AWS CLI (Protected by Access Keys) - access keys are single time given credentials(id and secret key) to access AWS services from terminal of our PC
    3. AWS SDK (for application code(coding language specific): protected by access keys) - access and manage AWS services programmatically embedded within application

Note - Access keys are generated through AWS Management Console
        Access Key Id (like username)
        Access Key (like secret password)



VPC(virtual private cloud) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.


AWS Services
    IAM(IAM Identity and Access Management) - Global service
            - create users(of your org) and assign them to user access groups(according to department)
            - JSON document called policies are used to define the permissions for users/group/role.

            IAM Policy structure - 
                - consists of -
                    "Version": policy language version, generally we use "2012-10-17"
                    "Id": an identifier for the policy(optional)
                    "Statement" : one or more individual statements (required)
                        Statement consist of - 
                            "Sid" : identifier for statement(optional)
                            "Effect" : "Allow" or "Deny", defines the statement whether it allows of denies access to certain APIs
                            "Principal" : account/user/role to which this policy applied to
                            "Action" : list of actions this policy allows or denies
                            "Resource" : list of resources to which the action applied to 
                            "Condition" : condition for when this policy is in effect(optional)

                - example policy;
                    {
                        "Version" : "2012-10-17",
                        "Id" : "S3-Account-Permissions",
                        "Statement" : [
                            {
                                "Sid" : "1",
                                "Effect" : "Allow",
                                "Principal" : {
                                    "AWS" : ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root"]
                                },
                                "Action" : [
                                    "s3:GetObject",
                                    "s3:PutObject",
                                    "iam:List*"         // allows all list___ operations on IAM using this policy
                                ],
                                "Resource" : ["arn:aws:s3::mybucket/*"],
                                "Condition" : 
                            }
                        ]
                    }
            
            IAM Roles -
                - Assigning specific permissions for the AWS services/accounts/external Web Identity for accessing AWS resources
                - Roles provide temporary security credentials(not userid/pass) to whomever has the ability to assume that role

            IAM Security Tools(Audit permissions of accounts)
                IAM Credentials Report (account-level)
                    - a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials

                IAM Access Advisor (user-level)
                    - Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed by users.


    EC2(Elastic Compute Cloud) - IAAS / Local Service (region specific)
            - Rent virtual machines (EC2)
            - Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
            - Distributing load across machines (ELB)
            - Scaling services using auto-scaling group (ASG)

            EC2 sizing/configuration options -
                - OS (Linux, Windows or Mac OS)
                - CPU (Computer Power and Cores) 
                - RAM
                - Storage Space 
                    - Network Attached (EBS & EFS)
                    - Hardware Attached (EC2 instance store)
                - Network Card
                - Firewall rules (Security group)
                - Bootstrap Script (configure at only first launch - EC2 user data)      
                        // Bootstrapping means launching commands in root access when the machine starts to handle boot tasks which includes   
                                            - installing updates/software
                                            - downloading common files from internet
            EC2 Instances Type
                - 
            Security Groups
                - network security of EC2(s) which controls how traffic is allowed inbound or outbound of our EC2 instances
                - by default, all INBOUND traffic is BLOCKED, and all OUTBOUND traffic is AUTHORISED
                - it's good to maintain one separate security group for SSH access.
                - we can refer another/multiple security group in new/one security group

                note - if application is not accessible due to (time out), then it's a security group issue
