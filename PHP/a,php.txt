- php is the server-side scripting language as well as general purpose programing language because php is object oriented. 
    So, the php scripts are executed on web-server to create dynamic pages.

*To Run Php Program -->
-Download php zip from php.org and extract to 'C:\php' 
    & set up this path to environment path variables to use executable files of C:\php from any directory we have our .php file situated
-create a php-server from xampp or cmd using command >php -S localhost:4040  at the directory path of programme
-go to browser and type > localhost:4040/                        - running apache server having port 4040    



syntax:
    <?php
        // First php programme
        # First php programme
        /*  First
            php
            programme   */
