James Gosling -> named Oak(Java)      (1991 - By Sun Microsystems(USA)) later (2010 - Sun Microsystems is aquired by 'Oracle Corp.' for $7.4 billion)
    - java is purely object oriented

*To Compile & Run Java Program -->
Exicute these in terminal of working directory..
javac fileName.java                                     javac app.java            Compiles in JDK and .class file is generated
java fileName.class										java app.class            Get executed on JRE(Java Runtime Environment in which JVM is embedded)
	SourceCode -> Compiler -> ByteCode -> JRE(JVM) -> Machine language


**DATA TYPES--
    Primitive->
    boolean Bool = true;                   -value can be true or false (size depends on JVM), default is false
   
    char _myName = 'A';                    -value ranges from 0 to [2^16]-1 (2 byte) with default value \u00 // char in java supports Unicode unlike others which supports ASCII(Subset of Unicode)
   
    byte x;                                -value ranges from -128 to 127 (1 byte - 8 bits) with default value 0
    short small_number;                    -value ranges from 2^16/2 to [2^16/2]-1 (2 byte) with default value 0
    int Num1;                              -value ranges from 2^32/2 to [2^32/2]-1 (4 byte) with default value 0
    long large_number = 356457578L;        -value ranges from 2^64/2 to [2^64/2]-1 (8 byte) with default value 0l or 0L

    float $currency$ = 1.54f;              -takes 4 byte with default value is 0.0f, we need to use f or F after floating constant...
    double Pivalue = 1.54;                 -takes 8 bytes with default value 0.00d or 0.00D

java.lang.String    
    String str = "this is string"          -strings are immutable, default value is null



**PRINTING OUTPUT--
        System.out.print("Hello ");                       
        System.out.println(name);
